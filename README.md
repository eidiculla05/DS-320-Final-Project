# DS-320-Final-Project - Group A7
## Medical vs. Environmental Determinants of Asthma: A Data-Driven Investigation 
### Overview 
This repository contains the final project for DS320: Data Integration. The goal of this project is to demonstrate an end-to-end data integration and modeling workflow, including data preparation, integration, model development, and evaluation. It will utilize the data set - Asthma Synthetic Medical Dataset obtained from Kaggle. 
### Repository Structure 
The project is organized into four R Markdown files to clearly separate each stage of the workflow. It also contains a final complied RMD file:
1. Data Cleaning & EDA
   - Data preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature preparation
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics and visualizations
2. Concatenation of Data
   - Integration of multiple data sets (CSVs)
   - Concatenation Based Integration (splitting of data)
3. Model Training
   - Model building (Random Forest & XGBoost)
   - Training predictive models using integrated data
4. Model Evaluation Metrics
   - Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics (F1 score, Accuracy, Precision, Recall)
   - Comparison of results and interpretation of outcomes

Final Compiled RMD
- A fully compiled R Markdown file that combines all steps into a single, reproducible report. Includes narrative, code, visualizations, and results​
